Today, a tricky problem was encountered, the dynamic programming is too hard for me, that's a bit of an overstep for me, I just learned the pointers.
I would ask one of my computer science classmate at Guangdong Polytechnic Normal University about dynamic programming, see you next time!

In this program, I will use structures and commons to complete relevant programming, including but not limited to struct and structure nesting, structure and common nesting, common body and common nesting, common body and structure nesting, as a student information input and retrieval system, but it's late now, I'll update the code tomorrow, see you tomorrow!

File : (Junior)Class Grade Input And Viewing Program Completed Using Structure Nesting

In this program I implemented the rudimentary function.You can enter the number of people you want to count and each of them' names, student numbers, grades in each subject, etc.

Also, the program allows you to access the information of these students using your student number or name.If you make a mistake, the system will prompt you to re-enter, if you enter it correctly, the information of the classmate will pop up, and if the total score of the classmate is lower than the average score of the class, the system will also generate an alert.

That's all, see you next time. I hope I can bring some crazy ideas when I log in Github this week!
